## _Boston vs.Global Temperature Averages_

This project compares the 7 year rolling average of Boston temperatures versus global temperatures. The required .csv files were queried from the Udacity SQL database. 

The final results do not take the first 6 years into consideration as the rolling average does not begin until year 7. To see the data with the first 6 years takin into consideration, see commit- feat: functional code and graph
